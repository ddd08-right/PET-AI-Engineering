# PET/CT Segmentation, Quantification, and Reliability Engineering

![CI](https://github.com/ddd08-right/PET-AI-Engineering/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Three evidence tracks are intentionally separate:

| Track | Evidence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native PyTorch teaching baseline | Synthetic tensors and CPU tests | Engineering education; no patient performance. |
| nnU-Net development case | One seed, fold 0, five development-validation cases | Real protected predictions; not independent testing or clinical validation. |
| Reliability utilities | Synthetic mathematical and engineering checks | A real-patient reliability study and AURC analysis are not complete. |

![Evidence overview showing three separate tracks: a synthetic native PyTorch baseline, a five-case single-seed/fold nnU-Net development case, and synthetic reliability validation. Independent testing, external validation, and a real-patient reliability study are incomplete.](docs/figures/evidence_overview.svg)

## Why this repository exists

This engineering / methodology repository explores how PET/CT segmentation
outputs can connect to physical quantitative endpoints and patient-level
reliability evaluation, rather than treating segmentation overlap as the only
endpoint. It is not a clinical validation study.

## Core technical evidence

- Native PyTorch 3D segmentation: dataset -> 3D U-Net -> loss -> backward pass -> optimizer update.
- Patient-level split checks and PET/CT geometry and segmentation-label QC.
- Physical binary-mask volume from a millimetre affine determinant; the legacy spacing-only API is explicitly limited to orthogonal voxel axes.
- Patient-level quantitative-error and reliability utilities with explicit edge-case policies.
- Risk--coverage evaluation with fixed-seed random, non-deployable best-case reference, and reverse controls.
- Automated tests, CI workflows, a public-repository guardrail, provenance utilities, and synthetic demos.

This repository is intentionally modest: it demonstrates public-safe software engineering patterns for PET/CT AI work using synthetic tests and explicit evidence labels. It does not claim that AutoPET, nnU-Net, Blackbean, or TCIA_processing were created here.

## 1. What this repository demonstrates

- Python modules for manifest validation, patient-level split checks, PET/CT spatial QC, segmentation label QC, voxel metrics, lesion metrics, hashing, and run manifests.
- Command-line scripts that call those modules rather than duplicating logic.
- Synthetic tests and a one-command synthetic demo that can run without patient data, GPU access, nnU-Net weights, or external downloads.
- Documentation that separates completed engineering work from planned research.

## 2. Evidence status

| Area | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manifest validation | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | Synthetic CSV tests and demo manifest. |
| Patient-level split validation | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | Synthetic patient keys only. |
| PET/CT geometry QC | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | Synthetic NIfTI images only. |
| Segmentation label QC | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | Synthetic NIfTI masks only. |
| Voxel-level metrics | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | Analytic arrays and synthetic masks. |
| Lesion-level metrics | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | Connected-component tests with synthetic masks. |
| Run provenance helpers | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | Synthetic file hashes and JSON manifests. |
| Physical mask and generic uptake quantification | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | NumPy invariant tests and synthetic methodology demo. |
| Patient-level reliability and risk--coverage | ENGINEERING_SMOKE | Deterministic NumPy tests, controls, and synthetic methodology demo. |
| nnU-Net orchestration wrappers | DEVELOPMENT_EXPOSED | Parameterized wrappers; not run by CI. |
| 40-epoch development baseline | DEVELOPMENT_EXPOSED | Single seed, fold 0, five development-validation cases; final and online-EMA-selected checkpoints evaluated. Not an independent test. |
| WinError 1455 and low-VRAM notes | HISTORICAL_PROJECT_RECORD | Historical local records only; not rerun here. |
| Clinical validation | PLANNED | No clinical validation is claimed. |

## 3. Architecture / pipeline

The modules can support manifest -> QC -> evaluation workflows, but the three
evidence tracks above were not executed as one patient-level end-to-end study.

Each stage has a small module under `src/pet_ai/` and a corresponding test or demo call. The scripts in `scripts/` are thin command-line entry points.

## 4. Quick Start

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"
python -m pytest -q -m "not pytorch"
python -m ruff check .
python scripts/verify_public_repo.py
```

## 5. One-command synthetic demo

```powershell
python scripts/demo_pipeline.py
```

The demo creates temporary synthetic PET, CT, ground-truth mask, and prediction mask files; validates a public-safe manifest; checks splits, geometry, labels, voxel metrics, lesion metrics, and run provenance; then removes temporary imaging files automatically.

## Native PyTorch 3D Baseline

The repository includes a small native PyTorch 3D segmentation baseline for engineering education:

- native `torch.utils.data.Dataset` with synthetic PET/CT tensors
- small 3D U-Net using `Conv3d`, pooling, transposed convolution, and skip connections
- BCE-with-logits plus soft Dice segmentation loss
- explicit training loop with `loss.backward()` and `optimizer.step()`
- unit tests for backward gradients and optimizer parameter updates
- CPU synthetic demonstration in `scripts/demo_pytorch_train.py`

Evidence boundary: this is a synthetic engineering demonstration only. It is not a clinical model, not a performance benchmark, and makes no clinical performance claims.

Install the pinned public PyTorch dependency and test tools, then run the CPU demo:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[test,pytorch]"
python scripts/demo_pytorch_train.py --device cpu
```

## 6. Data and patient-level split validation

`pet_ai.data.manifest` validates required public-safe fields and rejects obvious patient/private fields. `pet_ai.data.split_validation` checks that the same `patient_key` does not appear across train, validation, and test splits.

Development-exposed data must not be described as an independent test set.

## 7. PET/CT spatial and label QC

`pet_ai.qc.geometry` compares NIfTI shape, voxel spacing, orientation, and affine. `pet_ai.qc.labels` checks binary segmentation labels, NaN/Inf values, optional non-empty masks, and optional geometry alignment to a reference image.

The QC modules report problems. They do not silently resample, repair, or exclude cases.
NIfTI geometry requires an explicit recognized spatial unit and is normalized
to millimetres for comparison. Same-grid status allows index-wise comparison;
it does not prove anatomical registration. Project policy also requires at
least one coded qform or sform. A fallback affine with both codes zero is not
accepted as a verified physical-space source; two valid but conflicting coded
forms are rejected, while one valid form is sufficient.

## 8. Voxel-level segmentation evaluation

`pet_ai.evaluation.segmentation` reports TP, FP, FN, Dice, FPV_mL, and FNV_mL.
The standard formula gives Dice 0 for empty reference/non-empty prediction and
0/0 only when both are empty. This project's strict aggregation policy excludes
all empty-reference cases, retaining the historical `NaN`/`null` and
`UNDEFINED_EMPTY_GT` API label. It is therefore a non-empty-reference Dice,
not a claim that every empty-reference Dice is mathematically undefined.
Negative cases should be reviewed using false-positive volume.
Inputs must be finite, strictly binary, same-shaped 3D arrays. The NIfTI entry
point additionally rejects physical-grid mismatch before computing metrics.

## 9. Lesion-level evaluation

`pet_ai.evaluation.lesion_metrics` identifies 3D connected components in ground truth and prediction, measures lesion volumes in mL, and performs deterministic one-to-one overlap matching. Split/merge ambiguity is reported explicitly because overlap alone cannot determine biological lesion identity in those cases.

## 10. Reproducibility

`pet_ai.reproducibility.hashing` computes SHA256 file hashes.
`pet_ai.reproducibility.run_manifest` distinguishes a declared/requested seed
from an effective seed and its verification status. A declaration from the
PowerShell wrapper is not evidence that trainer RNG state was controlled.

## 11. Debugging / failure analysis

`docs/FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md` documents evidence-supported historical failures and separates software bugs, environment failures, resource failures, and scientific/model failures.

## 12. nnU-Net orchestration

`scripts/train_nnunet.ps1` and `scripts/infer_nnunet.ps1` are wrappers around upstream nnU-Net commands. They require explicit parameters and environment variables. CI does not train, infer, download weights, or require a GPU.

The completed 40-epoch, single-seed, fold-0 development case is documented in
[`docs/DEVELOPMENT_BASELINE_40E_CASE.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_BASELINE_40E_CASE.md),
with its public-safe aggregate record in
[`docs/development_baseline_40e_summary.json`](docs/development_baseline_40e_summary.json).
It includes real predictions and evaluation for the final checkpoint and the
checkpoint selected by the online EMA pseudo-Dice rule across five development
validation cases. The protected predictions and per-case evidence are not
published in this repository.

The public-safe method extraction and command/output contract are documented in
[`configs/development_baseline_40e/README.md`](configs/development_baseline_40e/README.md).
It is a `PARTIAL_RECIPE`: nnU-Net/PyTorch remain external historical
dependencies, protected data and weights are absent, and this repository did
not rerun training or inference.

The sampler diagram distinguishes case-slot assignment from upstream spatial
patch selection: [midpoint sampling method](docs/figures/midpoint_sampling.svg)
([PNG preview](docs/figures/midpoint_sampling.png)). The `0.82` value is a
slot-1 foreground-forcing probability, not a positive-case sampling rate.

Generate the self-contained SVG figures with Python only (no browser required):

```bash
python scripts/render_public_figures.py
```

PNG previews are optional. To regenerate them, explicitly supply a local
Edge/Chromium executable; a browser launch or render failure returns an error:

```powershell
python scripts/render_public_figures.py --edge /path/to/chromium
```

## 13. Research extensions - PLANNED ONLY

The following remain PLANNED unless future evidence is added: multi-center OOD, multi-tracer OOD, FDG -> PSMA transfer, validated SUV error, and study-defined tumor-volume biomarkers. The v0.3 reliability utilities are synthetic engineering evidence, not clinical evidence.

## 14. Evidence boundaries

Public executable tests and demos use synthetic data only. The public code and
synthetic examples can be run without protected data, but the private real-case
metrics cannot be independently recomputed from the public aggregates alone.
This repository does not contain patient images, PHI, patient mappings,
per-case real-data results, raw clinical spreadsheets, DICOM metadata dumps,
model weights, checkpoints, protected predictions, private logs, or secrets.

One traceable real-data development case is complete: a 40-epoch, single-seed,
fold-0 run with five development validation cases, including final and
online-EMA-selected-checkpoint predictions and evaluation. The public repository
contains only the de-identified aggregate results, method and provenance
summary, and limitations. Recorded source hashes support artifact identity and
traceability; they are not independent scientific validation. Complete OOF
coverage, an independent test set, external validation, and a reliability study
remain incomplete. Neither clinical effectiveness nor completion of the wider
research programme is claimed.

## 15. Third-party attribution

AutoPET, nnU-Net, Blackbean, and TCIA_processing are upstream or third-party work. See `THIRD_PARTY.md` for attribution boundaries.
